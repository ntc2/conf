# Gnome 2 and Gnome 3 configs are incompatible. This config contains
# settings that work in both Ubuntu 11.04 (EeePc, GNOME 2.32.1) and
# 11.10 (desktop, GNOME 3.2.1).
#
# UPDATE: and now Ubuntu 14.10 with GNOME 3.8. I left the old configs,
# but the 'RequiredComponents' had to change, so I don't know if this
# still works on older versions of Gnome. Going forward, I might
# instead want to use Mate, a fork of Gnome 2 that's used by Linux
# Mint.
#
# The ~/.xsession-errors is helpful for debugging some problems here,
# but on Ubuntu 11.10 I got no errors related to ignored keys
# (e.g. 'Required' when I need 'RequiredProviders'). The
# 'gnome-session' errors are reported to syslog, and adding '--debug'
# in ~/.xsession increases output.

#
# Switch to locally managed `.desktop` files, since everything seems
# to be gaining an incompatible `OnlyShowIn=<desktop>` setting. In
# these local copies, I make the `OnlyShowIn` like compatible with
# Unity.
#
# Could also try switching to `unity-panel` and
# `unity-settings-daemon`, as suggested here:
# http://blog.ezyang.com/2014/12/ubuntu-utopic-upgrade-xmonad/.

# At some point Gnome 3 stopped supporting the 'RequiredProviders'

# you just list all the things you want to run in the

# for me. So, it looks like they put all these stupid "OnlyShowIn"
# entries in the .desktop files, and then realized they cause
# problems ...
#
# UPDATE: these settings don't seem to matter: I've tried all
# combinations, but I still need to create the "local" versions of the
# `.desktop` files which comment out the `OnlyShowIn`
# sections. However, I need to reconsider these when the next Gnome
# upgrade breaks everything again.

# This is essential: otherwise there is no mouse cursor, the
# gnome-panel doesn't work, and you can't close the last
# xterm. According to http://askubuntu.com/a/541404/56280, the problem
# is that many Gnome .desktop files are configured to only run when
# the 'DesktopName' is set to "Unity".
