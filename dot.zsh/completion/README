Haskell completion from http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Zsh on 2011-3-29

Default Git completion on Ubuntu comes from

  /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/_git

installed by zsh package. If git is installed locally using
~/v/conf/install-git.sh, then git completion comes from
~/local/opt/git/contrib/completion/_git.
