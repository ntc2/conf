* pdfnup (from pdfjam package): variable trim + nup

usage examples:
: ./pdfnup --paper letterpaper --trim "3cm 5cm 4.5cm 3.5cm" <file>
: ./pdfnup --paper letterpaper --trim "3.5cm 3.5cm 3.5cm 3.5cm" <file>
: ./pdfnup --nup 1x1 --paper letterpaper \
:   --trim "1.5cm 3cm 1.5cm 0cm" <file>

the --trim options are <left> <bottom> <right> <top> and the program
seems to be "smart" in that it doesn't necessarily honor your
request :P
* pdfrescale (from a CMU student): scale based uniform trim
doesn't seem to like relative paths to target file, but relative path
to script is ok.

usage examples:
: ~/v/cpdt-reading-course.redmine.git/pdf-rescalers/pdfrescale outsidein-x-v3 1.3

there are many more options, such as --delta, that i have not used
* what i really want: something that draws lines on a pdf every .5 cm
remove the guess work from trimming
