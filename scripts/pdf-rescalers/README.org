* pdfnup (from pdfjam package): variable trim + nup

usage examples:
: bash pdfnup --paper letterpaper --trim "3cm 5cm 4.5cm 3.5cm" programming-with-narrowing.pdf
: bash pdfnup --paper letterpaper --trim "3.5cm 3.5cm 3.5cm 3.5cm" ~/outsidein-x-v3.pdf

the --trim options are <left> <bottom> <right> <top>
* pdfrescale (from a CMU student): scale based uniform trim
doesn't seem to like relative paths to target file, but relative path
to script is ok.

usage examples:
: ~/v/cpdt-reading-course.redmine.git/pdf-rescalers/pdfrescale outsidein-x-v3 1.3

there are many more options, such as --delta, that i have not used
* what i really want: something that draws lines on a pdf every .5 cm
remove the guess work from trimming
