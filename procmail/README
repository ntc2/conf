You need to set some variables in rc.gmail with a custom script that
is imported somewhere else, before rc.gmail is imported.

E.g., on uoregon.edu, I have a .procmailrc consisting of:

INCLUDERC=$HOME/rc.spamassassin
INCLUDERC=$HOME/rc.gmail.custom
INCLUDERC=$HOME/rc.gmail

The rc.spamassassin line was put there by the uoregon spam scripts.

rc.gmail.custom consists of:

ORIGINAL_ADDRESS=ncollin1_at_uoregon_dot_edu
