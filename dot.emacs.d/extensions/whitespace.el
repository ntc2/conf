;; Tabs
;;
;; I created a .dir-locals.el to configure tabs on git-annex, with
;; contents, but there were issues with unsafe command:
;; `(highlight-regexp "^ *")' for highlighting suspicious leading
;; spaces.
;;
;; ;; Configure emacs' treatment of tabs.
;; ;;
;; ;; See
;; ;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html
;; ;; for a description of this file.
;; ;;
;; ;; The 'nil' below applies to all modes.
;; ((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . t)
;;         (tab-width . 2)))

;;         ;; Highlight leading space characters, to avoid indenting with
;;         ;; spaces.

;;         ;; Emacs will prompt you about this, saying it's unsafe, but
;;         ;; you can permanently store an exception by pressing "!",

;;         ;; emacs still asks you on each file you open :P
;;         (eval . (highlight-regexp "^ *")))))

;; !!!: 'setq' does not work for 'tab-width'.
