" reverse video
" =============
"
" Install the BYM add-on.  The default shortcut is C-M-b.  It can be
" changed in the preferences, but doesn't take effect until after a
" restart.

" search engine shortcuts
" =======================
"
" by default, when you tell vimperator to open something that doesn't
" look like an address, e.g. with
" 
"   open the pickles
"
" it runs the shortcut with keyword defined by the defsearch variable.
" This variable defaults to 'google', which is the default keyword for
" google in firefox.  So, if you change the keyword for google, say to
" 'g', then this default search behavior breaks.  You can fix it by
" manually setting defsearch:
"
"   set defsearch=g
"
" Got this from:
" http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/detail?id=589
"
" XXX: need to figure out how to store the search engines.
"
" You can access the search engines and change the keywords with
"
"   dialog searchengines
"
" but the only way I know to *install* search engines is click on
" links, e.g. the 'search plugin' link at the top of
" haskell.org/hoogle.
