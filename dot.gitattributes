# Mark all files for autmatical end-of-line normalization.  Files are
# normalized *if* they identified as text by git's heuristics. See
# 'git help attributes'.
#
# To override this in a repo that already has files with messed up
# line endings, create a .gitattributes in the repo with contents
#
#   * text=unspecified
#
# or
#
#   * text=

# This creates too many problems when checking out repos I don't
# control, so I need to make it opt in, not opt out.
